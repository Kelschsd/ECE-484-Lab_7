# Lab_7

For this lab, we were asked to create an Android app to implement a simple button and counter.
I followed the tutorial at: https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/counter/
I skipped steps 2 and 3 of the tutorial, and had to make corrections to the provided code. The code from the tutorial did
not compile without errors on my version of Android Studio. I also changed the layout, text, and colors of the app to 
be appealing to me.

A demonstration video of my app running on my phone can be found at: https://youtube.com/shorts/rx3x3K9VmH0
